        <h3>His role in the battle of Chaeronea:</h3>
        <p>His father feigned a retreat and lured the Athenians into breaking their formation with the other Greeks.
            This
            left a gap that Alexander drove his troops into, at which point his father had his troops charge the Greeks.
            The Macedonians won the battle.
        </p>
        <h3>Events that resulted in him becoming the ruler:</h3>
        <p>During the festival procession for Alexander’s sister’s wedding, Pausanias, a young Macedonian noble,
            assassinated King Philip, and his motive was never discovered. Alexander’s troops declared him king, and he
            killed any remaining royals who could claim the throne.
        </p>
        <h3>Two major victories over the Persians:</h3>
        <h4>The Battle of Issus</h4>
        <p>King Darius of Persia and his troops were camped in Issus in northwest Syria. The Persian forces vastly
            outnumbered the Macedonians, but Alexander managed to charge the Persian left wing, which fell apart, and
            move
            towards Darius. He was forced to break off the attack on Darius to reinforce the rest of his troops, and
            Darius
            fled with most of his remaining troops. Persian losses were over one hundred thousand, and less than one
            thousand Greeks were killed.
            <br>
        <h4>The Battle of Gaugamela</h4>
        <p>Alexander and his forces faced King Darius and Persian forces that likely tripled the Greeks. After much
            maneuvering on both sides a gap emerged in the Persian forces which Alexander drove some of his forces into
            and
            charged Darius. The king and some of his troops fled, and a reserve unit of Macedonians drove back Persians
            who
            had gotten to their baggage train. The rest of the Persians eventually fled, and Alexander chased Darius for
            about seventy miles before giving up.
        </p>
        <h3>View(s) of other cultures:</h3>
        <p>He respected the cultures of the places he conquered and adhered to them while he stayed there. He spread
            some
            Greek culture in Egypt, and adopted a lot of practices he encountered in Asia, and eventually inducted many
            Persians
            into his army.
        </p>
        <h3>Circumstances in India that ended his conquests:</h3>
        <p>Alexander and his troops had been conquering for years, and when they were in India they refused to go any
            farther. After two days of trying to change their minds, he gave in and turned back. When Alexander was
            badly
            wounded on the way back his troops were worried and when he recovered they were really happy and let go of
            any
            resentment towards him.
        </p>
        <h3>Cause of his death:</h3>
        <p>He contracted malaria in Babylon as well as having a bad drinking problem, and at thirty-two years old.</p>
        <h3>Wife and children at his death:</h3>
        <p>He had two wives: Rhoxana, the daughter of a Bactrian prince, and Stateira, a daughter of King Darius. He had
            one
            son who died in India, and another born months after his death.
